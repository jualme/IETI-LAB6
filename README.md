### Part 3: Consume the Task Planner API from a React JS App

I did it in the last lab for the front end, [link](https://github.com/jualme/-IETI-LAB5) for th repository

It's not possible to access a http url form a https [reference link](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content), because of this the application in Heroku doesn't work.
